policy and handled separately through other procurement processes.
3. Guidelines for Selection of Books and Other Materials
When selecting books for the library, it is important to consider specific criteria to make

standard factors considered when choosing books:

academic programs, curriculum, and research needs of the institution. Research
interests, especially in emerging fields and interdisciplinary studies, should be
prioritized.

publishers are considered reliable.

acquisition methods and support the goal of maintaining a high-quality and
relevant collection.

and aligned with the institution's academic and research goals. The methodology for
acquiring books and other materials is divided into three types of purchases:

or distributors for specific titles or materials based on faculty recommendations,
departmental requests, and user demands, ensuring that the materials procured
are aligned with academic and research needs.
a) This method ensures high-priority or essential materials, especially textbooks and reference works.
b) In view of the urgency, the library may directly purchase books costing up
to Rs. 25,000/- based on recommendations through a requisition form or email.

purchased with the approval of LAC and Competent Authority and the procedures
