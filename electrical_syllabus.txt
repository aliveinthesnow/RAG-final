Department of Electrical Engineering:
Brief about the Department:
The Department of Electrical Engineering was established in the year 1959 in the Regional
Engineering College Warangal, which was converted into a National Institute of Technology
in the year 2003.
Since the inception of the Institute, the department has been developing state-of-the-art
Infrastructure to cater to the needs of technical education and cutting-edge research. In its
formative years, the department received considerable financial and logistical support from
UNESCO. Later, the Department was funded principally by the MHRD, GOI, which is
augmented by aid from various other agencies such as the Institutional Network Scheme (INS)
and TEQIP. Well-qualified, well-trained and dedicated faculty propels the development of the
department. The department enjoys a position of eminence in the field of technical education
and research. The Department of Electrical Engineering started offering postgraduate
programs since the year 1964. Currently, the Department offers three PG programs in Power
Systems Engineering, Power Electronics and Drives, and Smart Electric Grid.
The establishment of postgraduate courses has significantly contributed towards the
advancement of research and consultancy activities of the department. To fulfill the objectives
stated in the mission and vision of the institute, the department organized several faculty
development programs, conferences, and refresher courses, which cater to the needs of
industries and utilities (DRDO, BHEL, TATA power companies, VSP to name a few). The
department also organized several continuing education programs in emerging areas for
faculty of educational institutions throughout the country. The Department is recognized as a
QIP center for M. Tech programs in Electrical Engineering.
The Department of Electrical Engineering has always been a hub of active research. Several
research projects, sponsored by MHRD, CSIR, DST, DRDO, SPARC, and other private and
governmental organizations have successfully been executed by the faculty of the
department. Currently, about 65 doctoral students are pursuing their Ph.D. degrees in various
areas of research.
In its sixty-two years of journey, the department had quite a few academic and research
accomplishments. A few of them are enumerated below:
● Several funded research projects, to the tune of Rs. 300 Lakhs, are currently under
execution, promising high research outcomes.
● A Power System Study Cell was established by the erstwhile APSEB to train their
engineers in software pertaining to power systems.
● A sponsored research project was successfully executed, which aims to study the impact
of the electrical load of the Vizag Steel Plant on the grid. This project was awarded to the
department despite stiff competition from several institutes of higher learning.
● The department has been awarded a center of excellence in power and energy systems,
which is in the process of being established.
● All academic programs offered by the department had been accredited by NBA for a fulltime period of 5 years in the years 2008 and 2013
● As many as 26 consultancy projects were completed for the vetting of electromechanical
designs for lift irrigation projects by the Governments of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
