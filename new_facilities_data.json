NITW\n\n**Android Devices Connection Process:**\n\n**Step 1:**\nInstall 'Clearpass Quick Connect' app from Google Play store. Grant necessary permissions after installation.\n\n**Step 2:**\nConnect to 'Provisioning' SSID. Click 'Sign in to WLan Network'. Use Campus mail-id. A password will pop up on your mobile.\n*Note:* If 'Sign in to WLAN network' pop-up doesn't appear, open Google Chrome and visit: `https://aaa-1.nitw.ac.in/guest/Provisioning_Onboarding.php`\n(Note: 'Provisioning' has a Capital P, 'Onboarding' has a Capital O).\n\n**Step 3:**\nSelect 'I have already installed Quick Connect'. Download the network profile.\nOpen the downloaded file using 'QuickConnect'.\nAfter clicking `quick1x.networkconfig`, it will successfully connect to NITW network and start provisioning.\n\n**Final Step:**\nAfter successfully completing the above process, connect to 'NITW' SSID only (not Provisioning).\nThis is a one-time process. Next time onwards, connect directly to 'NITW'.",
