The quality of the food was excellent, far better than I expected. I ordered dosa and poori, thinking I could easily finish both, but to my surprise, just one dosa was so filling that it completely satisfied my hunger! The portion size was generous, and the texture of the dosa was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft inside.\n\nThe poori was equally delicious \u2014 light, fluffy, and paired wonderfully with the curry. Overall, the meal felt homely yet restaurant-quality at the same time.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who loves authentic South Indian flavors, I\u2019d highly recommend giving this place a try. Both the dosa and poori are totally worth it.\n\nI\u2019m already looking forward to trying their other dishes in the future \u2014 stay tuned for my next food update! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\u2728",

Since options near the temple are limited, this was a convenient choice. The hotel is on the main road, easy to find, though some traffic noise can be heard in the rooms.\n\nRooms are spacious, clean, and well-furnished for a three-star property. The bathroom was fine, though a towel hook would help. Toiletries were decent, and the mini fridge was handy. Housekeeping and reception service were professional.\n\nThe restaurant food was average and a bit spicy for our taste. The walls are not soundproof, and we were disturbed by noise from nearby rooms.\n\nOverall, a comfortable and practical hotel for visitors to Ramappa Temple and other heritage sites around Warangal.",

The rooms are decent size and have the basic amenities like TV, kettle, AC, locker water bottles and the bathroom was clean and neat too. The kettle wasn\u2019t working but after raising a complaint they changed it. The room phone had some issue where I could not hear the person on the other side even after increasing the volume. Didn\u2019t bother to ask them to change as they had a mobile number which could call for the reception and the restaurant. The restaurant food was good with south and North Indian dishes covered. The breakfast menu was limited though with no fruits at all on the menu. The location of the hotel is good as it\u2019s easily accessible to most of the prominent places within 5 kms. Overall I would say a budget hotel without any perks for a short stay.",

However, the non-veg biryani is quite disappointing and definitely not worth the price. On the other hand, vegetarian dishes are superb, making them the real highlight of the menu.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a place worth visiting for its ambience, service, and starters \u2014 just keep in mind that everything feels slightly overpriced for what\u2019s served.",

The Jungle Themed ambiance was truly impressive and perfectly matched the restaurant\u2019s name! It gave a unique and fun vibe, especially for a family outing.\n\nWe actually stepped in while looking for a good spot to celebrate our anniversary lunch, the valet parking caught our attention, and we\u2019re so glad we chose this place!  The food was delicious, and the staff were courteous and attentive, even though the restaurant was quite busy with the weekend crowd.\n\nWhile the serving style could use a bit of improvement (probably due to the rush), the overall experience was memorable. The creative jungle decor and atmosphere really made it stand out.\nDefinitely a place worth visiting for families and groups looking for something different!",

It seemed like they mixed some plain grains of rice, reheated it, and sent it for delivery.\n\nWe paid nearly \u20b92000 for this meal, but the quality was absolutely unacceptable.

The starter was recommended by the waiter and came awesome. Nice flavour and moist chicken, that day's special. Special chicken Biriani was flavourful but light in heat. Good for two people. From myside a good five \u2b50.\n\nThe icecream was slightly overpriced I guess and the like soda was not quite good. Here I feel they need to workout.\n\nHighly recommend this place for people new to this area. The waiter was polite and other waitress was also good. They are know Telugu and English very well.

I felt the price is for packaging.I don't suggest this rice bowl.overall the bowl is a bad experience.",

The ambience was simple yet comfortable, perfect for a relaxed meal.\n\nFood:\nThe food was genuinely delicious. On the waiter\u2019s recommendation, we tried the Chicken Dum Biryani \u2014 it was flavorful, aromatic, and easily one of the best biryanis I\u2019ve had in Warangal. We also ordered Lemon Chicken (possibly Lemon 65), which had the perfect tangy-spicy balance and was very well prepared. Along with that, we tried a Veg Paneer Biryani, which was good, though not as remarkable as the chicken one. For drinks, we had Mango Lassi, Diet Coke, and Lime Soda \u2014 all refreshing and nicely served. Overall, the food quality and taste were impressive.\n\nService:\nThe service truly stood out. The waiter who attended to us was extremely polite, friendly, and attentive. He greeted us warmly, made great food suggestions, and ensured we were comfortable throughout. It\u2019s rare to come across such genuine hospitality, and that really enhanced our dining experience.\n\nOverall, President Dhaba is a must-visit in Warangal if you\u2019re looking for good food, warm service, and a satisfying dining experience. Highly recommended!",

It\u2019s a cozy and relaxing place, perfect for catching up with friends or spending some quiet time alone. The ambience is modern yet calm \u2014 with soft lighting, comfortable seating, and a decent music playlist that isn\u2019t too loud.\n\nI tried their cold coffee and a brownie with ice cream, both of which were well-prepared. The coffee had a strong, rich flavor without being too sweet, and the brownie was warm, soft, and balanced well with the ice cream.\n\nThe menu offers a decent variety \u2014 from hot and cold coffees to milkshakes, sandwiches, and snacks. Prices are quite reasonable for the quality and the setting.\n\nThe staff was polite, and service was smooth, though it took a little time during a busy hour. The caf\u00e9 seemed clean and well-maintained.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d What I liked:\n\u2022\tRelaxed atmosphere, perfect for casual meetings or solo time\n\u2022\tGood coffee and dessert options\n\u2022\tPolite service and reasonable prices\n\n\ud83d\udc4e What can improve:\n\u2022\tSlightly faster service during peak time\n\u2022\tMore variety in food/snack options would be a plus\n\nFinal Word:\n\nCoffee Lounge is a great little spot in Warangal for coffee lovers and people looking for a peaceful hangout. Whether you\u2019re on a date, meeting friends, or just need a break \u2014 it\u2019s a nice place to unwind with a cup in hand.",

My visit here was very disappointing \u2014 the place is extremely unhygienic, with no proper air conditioning, fans, or cleanliness.\n\nThe staff response was poor, and even for meals, it\u2019s self-service \u2014 you have to go and collect rice and curries yourself. The food taste was below average, and overall service was not at all satisfactory.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to visit with your family or children, I strongly suggest avoiding this place. The environment is not suitable for families, and even parking is a big challenge. It\u2019s surprising that they also run a function hall, considering how poorly the restaurant itself is maintained.\n\nHonestly, this place seems suitable only for tea, coffee, or a quick smoke, not for proper meals or tiffins. I hope the management seriously works on cleanliness, service, and food quality.\n\n\u2b50 Overall Rating: 1/5\n\ud83d\udccd Near the bridge, Khammam",

The place itself is quite large, but the aesthetics and decor leave a lot to be desired \u2014 it feels functional rather than cozy or stylish.\n\nFood:\nWe tried a few biryanis during our visit. One of them was extremely spicy \u2014 much spicier than we expected, while another, a regular dum biryani, was more balanced but just average in taste. Overall, the flavors were okayish, not as impressive as we had hoped considering the variety on the menu.\n\nValue & Experience:\nThe prices were reasonable and not too expensive, so in terms of quantity and cost, it was fair. While the food was decent enough to satisfy hunger, the taste and overall experience were somewhat underwhelming compared to other biryani places in Warangal.",

Here's my detailed The food was flavorful, well-prepared, and served hot. The menu offers a wide range of options \u2014 from Indian classics to Indo-Chinese favorites. The paneer butter masala and chicken biryani were standouts \u2014 rich in taste and portioned generously. The spice levels were perfect, and everything tasted fresh.\nThe staff was polite, attentive, and quick to respond. They helped us choose some dishes and were courteous throughout. Service was a bit slow during peak hours, but nothing too frustrating.\nThe interiors were clean and well-lit, creating a comfortable dining environment. Whether you're with family, friends, or on a casual date, the space feels inviting and relaxed.\nReasonably priced for the quality and quantity of food. It's great value for money \u2014 especially if you're going in a group. Portions are decent and easily shareable.\nTables were sanitized, washrooms were clean, and the kitchen area looked well-maintained \u2014 always a big plus!",

One notable aspect of the restaurant is the wide variety of items available on the menu, offering ample choices to suit different preferences. However, our go-to choice was the Chicken Dum Biryani, and it did not disappoint.\nThe biryani was excellently prepared, with the right amount of spiciness that suited my taste buds perfectly. The chicken pieces were tender, smooth, and packed with flavor. The accompanying gravy complemented the biryani wonderfully. The quantity served was sufficient to satisfy our appetites. We also appreciated the availability of cold drinks to accompany our meal.\nAdditionally, the price of the biryani was reasonable, which further added to the positive aspects of the restaurant.

They have a decent menu with some good number of items, and I will visit again to try them. I'd definitely recommend it to others.\nOne thing which was odd and stood away from other restaurants is they don't provide you with regular water and I haven't been asked to buy a bottle while they were taking the order. I had to order it in between the meal which was slightly uncomfy. That's why a star less.",

Even after I told them I was with my family\u2014ladies and kids were waiting on the road\u2014they kept saying they would give it, but they never did. When I questioned them firmly, the person said, 'You have to wait, or I will return your amount.' They spoke as if we were helpless or had no other choice, and as if they were giving us something for free. When there is such a busy crowd, they should at least implement some kind of token system for service. Instead, they prioritize their favorites, or perhaps 'white-collar' or 'premium' customers, and serve them first.",

The first thing to notice was that there was no intentional presentation planned while packing , but the color made this food interesting and attractive. Quantity also was unexpected , more than normal which definitely is good , taste was on point , the dryness and properly cooked chicken 65 with curry leaves and green chillies fried to perfection all adds to the dish. Never heard of this place before but for a quick snack I would definitely recommend this,  as the price is low with taste better than some well known places. Great.",

To my absolute shock, I found the prices to be remarkably reasonable, making it accessible for everyone to indulge in delightful Western cuisine.\n\nThis establishment has truly brought a taste of the West to Warangal. I sampled a variety of dishes, including the Veg Machow Soup, Peri Peri Fries, Fish Bites, Alfredo Pasta, and Mixed Hakka Noodles. Each dish was nothing short of perfection\u2014an embodiment of culinary brilliance.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warmth by RK, whose hospitality was exceptional, along with Ravi, who attended to our table with great care. The team\u2019s coordination was impressive, reflecting a well-orchestrated effort to ensure a memorable dining experience.\n\nWhile I noticed some reviews expressing concerns about authenticity, it\u2019s essential to appreciate the meticulous effort they put into recreating these Western dishes while infusing them with the unique essence of Warangal. Hats off to the team for their creativity and dedication!\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend December Delights Cafe to family and friends, and I look forward to returning soon.",

We Started with Chicken Manchow soup (5/5), it was really good, the spice levels, thickness of soup, everything was spot on. We asked for their recommendation when it came to appetizers, they advised to go with\n1) Grilled chicken with garlic sause(3.5/5)\n2) Peri peri chicken wings (3.5/5)\nOne thing I noticed here with the appetizers is their style of cooking is more towards subtle side ( It\u2019s not too spicy, salty, sweet, or tangy everything is balanced and mild). So if you are someone who like your food more spicy, try mentioning it while you are placing your order and wait to see how it turns out. Being someone who likes spicy food, though I haven't mentioned, It turned out decent to me. We've Also ordered Chicken tikka large Pizza, which was decent.\nIt is highly obvious that most of us find the quantity they provide towards a lower side because, remember you are not walking into a restaurant, it's a cafe, meant for lighter meals.",

The staff are friendly, attentive, and genuinely eager to make your experience delightful. They were happy to customize dishes, accommodate special requests, and guide me through the menu.\n\nIn terms of value, while it leans toward the premium side, the quality, ambiance, and service more than justify the pricing. On JustDial, it already enjoys a strong reputation \u2014 rated 4.8 by many customers.\n\nIf I had to mention something to improve \u2014 occasionally a dish could be hotter at the time of serving \u2014 but that\u2019s a minor quibble in an otherwise exceptional dining experience.",

The taste of both dishes were really good and we liked it very much. Particularly Kachori's were served with the fillings similar to rajbog kachori. The curd was not added in the fillings but still we enjoyed it. They have wide varieties of sweets. It's a must visit place.",

We started with the Pathar ka Chicken special; it had a nice smoky flavor, but the taste felt totally off, not spicy at all, and I like my food spicy. Green chutney saved it a bit.\n\nThen we had Butter Naan with Hyderabadi Chicken Curry. This was the highlight, good spice, tasty curry, and enough quantity for two naans. But the chicken wasn\u2019t tender. And the naan was disappointing , Honestly, one of the worst I\u2019ve ever had, its rubbery, hard to tear, and just frustrating to eat.\n\nFinally, we tried the Zafrani Chicken Biryani... and wow, that was the sweetest biryani I\u2019ve ever had. Please, move this to the dessert section of the menu. Made me hate biryani for a second.\n\nPrices were a bit high, but service was great. Now I finally get what they mean when they say food\u2019s not always great at famous places.",

The day when I took take away staff forgot to cook food and on multiple requests they gave food after 40 mins. Attached is the bill and burned butter nan. They have given burned butter nan and less nan quantity than billed one. When I call for the reason staff was telling do what ever you want but this is what we serve. This is the Situation of Pista house now.\nThink more before you visit Pista house..\ud83e\udd22",

Thank you for making me hopeful. Biryani is yum. Please maintain the quality in the future too. It will be my go to biryani place in hanmakonda. I will bring all my friends and family here. Don\u2019t even try any other place. All other restaurants serve biryani with rice cooked separately and then add some gravy curry which is not dum. Please don\u2019t change your spice level for the people who are leaving negative reviews for the spice level. It\u2019s insane that every other restaurant serve them and some people even add chilli powder in the rice. Remain authentic to the recipe and people will adapt to the taste.",

It's open till 11 at night to dine in... But if u want to sit and eat without hurry be there by atleast 10:30-10:40. Post 11 only take away for a limited time.",
