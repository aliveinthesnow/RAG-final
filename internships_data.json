Online Test\n2. Technical Interview -1\n3. Technical Interview  -2\n4. Technical + HR interview\nDescription of Online test:\nThis round was of 2.5 hrs and comprised of 5 sections:\nA.\tDebugging Round (20 Minutes) :\nThere were 7 problems. And in each problem statement, input /output (expected) and code was given and we needed to debug the given code to  pass all the test cases.\nB.\tCoding Round (70 Minutes):\nThere were 2 problems of medium level .\nOne problem was to count all substring having at most K distinct characters and another was to find the maximum of all subarrays of size k .\nC.\tBehavioral Round (20 Minutes):\nIn this round many situational problems (MCQs) were given to test your behavior, leadership principle and moral values.\nD.\tAptitude Round (35 Minutes ) :\nThere were 24 Aptitude problems.\nDescription of Technical Interview:\nTechnical Interview Round 1:\nInterviewer started off by giving a small introduction of himself and he asked me to introduce myself. In this round the interviewer asked me 2 coding problems based on data structures and algorithms.\nFirst problem was that \u2013 we have a binary tree and we need to print the binary tree in vertical order (Vertical Order Traversal). I told him the optimized approach and also discussed space and time complexities , then he asked me to write code in \u2018amazon code live\u2019.\nAfter this he asked me another problem \u2013 we are given N petrol pumps on a circle and at each petrol pump, distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump and amount of petrol at that petrol pump is given . We need to tell the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps without losing petrol in between two petrol pumps. I explained both brute force and optimized O(N) approach and then he asked me to code optimized approach again in \u2018amazon code live\u2019.\nTechnical Interview Round 2:\nInterview started with my introduction. And in this round also the interviewer asked me 2 coding problems. Both problems were of Dynamic Programming (DP).\nFirst question was that \u2013 we have a N-ary tree and and we need to print  kth ancestor of all nodes of binary tree .I started discussion with brute force and for further optimization I discussed Binary Lifting Technique (DP approach) to find kth ancestor  and time & space complexities  . After that I  coded it.\nSecond problem was that \u2013 we are given K dice and we need to tell no. of ways to get N (sum of all dice output). I discussed DP approach (optimized ) and then he asked me to code for both DP methods \u2013 Top-down and Bottom-up .\nDescription of HR Round:\nTechnical + HR Round (Final Round)\nFirstly Interviewer gave his introduction and asked me to introduce myself. Then Interviewer asked me to explain one of my projects . I explained my project in which Reactjs and Reduxjs were used .\nSo he asked some questions on Reactjs and Reduxjs .\nThen he gave me one situational problem and asked  how I\u2019ll react to  this situation .\nAfter that  he gave me a problem that we are building a web application in which a delivery boy gets the destination address whenever someone books in order. And I need to give a solution for deciding  the shortest path from the starting point of the delivery boy to his destination.  Actually it was a Graph question and I discussed Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm to solve this problem . I also discussed space and time complexity. Then he asked me to code.\nAt last he asked me to ask some questions if I have any.\nKeep practicing DSA problems from InterviewBit, Leetcode or GFG. Also give equal importance to  CS subjects(OS,DBMS) and OOPs. Keep your resume ready with 2-3 good projects in Web development or Android development or Machine Learning. And make sure that you should be perfect in everything you have written in your resume .\nWhen a question is asked, be confident, start with the Brute Force approach  and keep communicating with the interviewer and let him/her know about your approach.\nCompetitive Programming: Codechef, Codeforces, Hackerearth\nDSA: Leetcode, InterviewBit, GFG\n1.

Medium level aptitude questions were asked.\nE.\tFeedback. Giving feedback was important. Although it doesn't had time limit, but your test was not considered as complete without filling the feedback. Feedback was asked about their platform.\nDescription of Technical Interview:\nThe round was held on amazon chime and a live codepair link was given to write code. The interview started with a small introduction by the interviewer, and he just asked my name and branch, and was not at all interested in this. He directly moved on to the coding part. Two questions were asked, one was based on optimisation and second was modification of buying and selling of stock with certain constraints. The interviewer was very much focused on my approaches. Every time I say something, he always tells me to code this and show him how it will work so be confident about whatever you speak. The round lasted for 1 hr 15 mins, nothing else was asked except dsa questions.\nDescription of HR Round:\nFor the people in the circuit branch, be focused on the dsa subject that you have. Start preparing last to last by 2-2, that's high time. Give contests regularly on leetcode and codeforces(optional). Also parallely keep preparing other required subject  i.e. OOPS and DBMS. Try to make small small projects which will be very much useful on your resume. Build your resume one month before starting the intern drive. In summer vacations, Solve interviewbit completely as revision. Be consistent with problem solving.\nAt the time of intern drive, there will be situations when you'll not be shortlisted for certain companies and your friend will get selected, keep yourself motivated at that time. This is very much important. Don't rush for a particular company, whenever there is a test, always try to give your best. Your hardwork will surely give you results. If you feel low anytime, talk to your friends, your parents, your seniors. They will cheer you up.Reach out your seniors for any kind of help at any point of time. All the best!\nCoding platforms- Leetcode(must do for dsa), GFG, Interviewbit(must solve complete interviewbit one month before the drive), codeforces(for CP)\nYoutube channels- Code n code(for graphs), Aditya Verma(many topics are there, best for DP), code with harry, love babbar(DSA Cheatsheet), Abdul Bari(for algorithms), Sanchit Jain(DBMS), Tushar Roy\nwebsites- javatpoint(reading for oops) w3schools, gfg, In leetcode always go through discussions after solving a problem\nAdditional info for our viewers:",

The entire test is proctored. First question is on hashmap. It is an easy level question and if you have a basic idea on hashmaps it can be solved in 5-10 minutes and second question is that you have to print the shortest palindrome of two given strings. It is a standard dp model question. If you are able to do DP upto moderate level, you can do it very easily. Third question is also based on DP(dynamic programming). The question has twists and it took some time for me to identify that it is a DP problem. Finally, I space optimised and solved it completely. It is a medium to hard level question. Finally, the fourth question is on 2d matrix. It is a medium to hard level question. I solved it for a long time and submitted it but I was confused whether it got submitted or not as I lost my internet connection at the last moment. Till now it's suspicious for me whether it got submitted or not.\nDescription of Technical Interview:\nIn the first technical round interviewer was cool and very friendly.He had given me a question in a hackerrank based on priority queue .It is easy level question.And later he asked how I can implement priority queue using classes .He asked me to prototype and explain the implementation and all stuff.I explained it briefly until the interviewer gets satisfied.\nIn the second technical interview also interviewer was very friendly.He has given me a question and asked me to tell approach for it.It is based on stacks.It is medium level type question.And later he asked me about my DBMS project and went deeply into it.Also he asked my few oops concepts .Finally ,after asking few hr questions interview was finished.\nDescription of HR Round:\nThere is no separate round for HR\nIt is combined with the second technical round only.They asked me:\nWhy do you want to join Bny Mellon,\nWhat's your favourite subject in engineering,\nHow will you deal with the stressful situations,and a few more questions were asked.\nDon't give routine answers .Try to give answers that can impress him.\nDo CP well. It's enough to qualify for the OTs.\nBe thorough with OOPs and DBMS also about the project if you have done any..\nWhile following the playlist don't just blindly watch the whole video .First listen to the question and open that question in leetcode/gfg and give it a try. Spend at least 20-30 minutes to solve that question. If you can't figure out the solution, then resume and in the middle somewhere you will definitely get the idea. And then try once again, and if you don't get it, then only watch the complete video.\nAlso another important thing ,after solving a question in leetcode,go to the discussion section and watch the others solution so that you can make out different approaches. Most of the learning takes place here only.\nAlso complete the interviewbit in the last 3 months. Try to complete at least 60% of the problems in it.\nAditya Verma,takeuforward YouTube channels for coding.There will be playlists for important concepts in those YouTube channels.\nGfg,leetcode , interviewbit for practicing coding questions.\nKnowledge gate YouTube channel for dbms\nOops you can study from anywhere.I personally followed code with Harry YouTube channel and practiced questions in gfg.\nAdditional info for our viewers:\n1.All your coding skills will be tested in your ot only.Most of the time the coding questions asked in your interview will be easier than the questions those were asked in the ots .\n2.Don't get tensed in the interviews.Generally most of the interviewers are really very friendly.\n3.Don't think that non-cse branch students cannot get into software easily.ofc it's not easy than cse ,but if you have enough preparation it is easy.\n4.Be thorough with oops and dbms.\nLanguage doesn't matter for oops.If you are comfortable with c++,then go with it.\n5. If you have good rating  in any of the cp websites it gives some positive impression .But it is not the case that if you don't have good rating you can't get selected.Even though  you don't have any rating it doesn't matter if you have good coding skills.\n6.Last and final thing ,there can be cases like even if you solve all the questions in ot you may not get selected and others who solves partially may get selected.This might happens and happened also.Dont get demotivated in those cases ,just smile and keep going . Always remember one thing..hardwork always pays off!!",

The role specification depends on the modality and the necessity of the work. Both hardware and software choices will be available at each modality.\nRound 1 - Online Test\nRound 2 - Pymetrics gamified assessment\nRound 3 - Technical\nRound 4 - HR\nDescription of Online test:\nOnline test had 3 sub sections. Aptitude section has 50MCQs to be solved in 50 minutes .The second section had technical questions 30 questions, 30 min. For software, the topics include DSA, DBMS, OS, and CN.  And two coding questions, for which 45 minutes were allotted. The coding questions were of medium level problems one was based on dynamic programming and other was linked list problem.\nOn the same day, pymetrics test link was sent to the selected candidates. It is a game-based assessment consisting of 12 games. It tests the numerical and logical reasoning of the candidate to assess one's behaviour. Elimination for further rounds was done through this test too.\nDescription of Technical Interview:\nIt was like a rapid fire round, in my case. Initially, we were informed that  they would be hiring for both hardware and software roles. But no clarity was given on who would be having interviews for which role. In my case, as I am from EEE, questions were covered from software, hardware and electrical questions. The following are the questions:\n3)Difference between BJT and MOSFET\n5)Why do we use voltage regulator?\n7)Different data structures and uses\n8)Which field are you interested to work in?\nAnd depending on the answers, further explanation was asked. But the interviewer was so cool and asked questions only based on the previous semesters\u2019 knowledge at that point of time.\nAfter my two month internship in the company, I had a technical interview based on my project in those two months and a few situation based questions. I had done my internship in hardware role and the project was \"Battery Health Monitoring for Darwin Anesthesia Machine\". This interview was taken by an external(outside GE) person. The questions were:\n1) What was your project about?\n2) What did you learn from your project?(detailed explanation)\n3)What would you do to improve the current project?\n4)How is the work culture in GE?\n5)What is your biggest weakness?(it led to multiple questions)\nA few situation based questions like\n\"If you were given a task and you do not know anything about it, how would you move forward?\"\n\"Do you believe in team work? And would you help your teammates with their work?\"\n\"Who is more important to you, family or company?\" ( prolonged for lot of time)\nDescription of HR Round:\n2)What do you know about GE Healthcare?\n3) What did you find interesting in GE healthcare?\n4)What are the projects you have finished?\n5)Have you ever fought with your peers and how did you resolve it?\n6)What are your strengths and weaknesses?\n7)What are your areas of interest?\n8)In which position would you like to see yourself five years later?\n9)Would it be okay for you to relocate?\nGeneral questions about project and the other questions were:\n2)What is your review on GE healthcare?\n3)How was your interaction with the other employees?\n4)What did you like in GE Healthcare?\n5)Why do you think we should hire you among all the other candidates?\n6)Do you have any other plans like M.S. or further studies?\nA few logical questions like \" How do you divide a paper into 3 parts without using anything?\"\nFor bagging an internship, after B.Tech 2nd year, the summer break should be utilised well. Doing courses and projects related to your area of interest will help you improve your skills and build a good resume. Adding to that, it gives you confidence while facing the internship session pressure. For software preparation, one can improve upon themselves, by practicing and coding more problems, optimising at each step, each day.  For hardware preparation, in analog and digital electronics having basic knowledge and good notes from the earlier semesters would be sufficient. Practice and revision, both, should be in hand for any preparation.\nFor software preparation, leetcode provides a lot of problems ranging from easy to medium to hard.\nFor solving aptitude questions:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiDoPUX9nLkJ8dnPgKoVEOiAb8BfulKRR\nFor digital integrated circuits:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpelQYOtPS_GffAjTNVRyy-QW5ydtkYvg\nAdditional info for our viewers:\nSmall improvements can bring big change- I believe in this. Beginning of any new activity always stimulates fear. And having fear is completely normal, but one needs to maintain fear as well as confidence in equal ratio, to get one's maximum output. And there is no late point to start preparation. Learning is a continuous process. Do not lose the hope in you due to the external pressure. Keep your calm and do your best.",

First, he looked into my resume and asked for a small introduction of my projects, then he asked me to write some tables and their attributes from my DBMS project in the hackerrank code editor.\nThen he modified one of the tables and gave a question and told me to write a SQL query. The query was using aggregate function and group by clause. Then he asked me if I knew trees, to which I said yes. Then I was asked to write a pre-order traversal code (using recursion was fine) along with its time and space complexity. Then he asked which tree is best for searching and some indexing in the database question(I answered B tree).\nRound 1 was over and he seemed satisfied with all my answers.\nRound 2-\nHe looked into my resume and asked about my DBMS project. Then he moved on to the coding part-\nQ1- Given a string, we have to find the first non- repeating character in the string.\nEx- string is \"sggssjda\" then output will be 'j'\nI first told my approach to solve it and then he asked me to write the code and then execute it.\nI solved it using hash-map and also given time complexity.\nQ2- To find the kth largest element from a given array. For this he said just to write pseudo code. I gave two approaches i.e. using priority queue and using sorting (quick sort) along with their time complexities. But he was asking about a more optimized method which I couldn't but then he said that's okay.\nMoving forward, he asked questions from oops part, like encapsulation with real life examples, inheritance with examples. After this, we discussed a lot about method overriding, method overloading, runtime and compile time polymorphism etc.\nThen he asked me to define normalisation with any example by writing table names with its attributes in the code editor. Then he asked about the normal form of the given example to which I explained the criteria of all the normal forms and then identified it.\nRound 2 was over then and I was asked to wait for round 3\nDescription of HR Round:\nRound 3-\nThis was the HR round and it lasted only for 10-15mins. He looked into my resume and asked about my projects. Then he asked many questions by giving situations related to working on some group project.\nThey mainly focused on my dbms skills and were looking for a required knowledge about oops and problem solving part.

Candidates were shortlisted based on this form response.\nDescription of Online test:\nThere was no online test\nDescription of Technical Interview:\nThere were two technical interviews. Both based on my CV. I had a Data Science oriented CV because of which the questions in the first round were on Data Science and my Project. The questions were:\n1) Difference between AI and Data Science\n2) Algorithm of Support Vector Machines\nAnd a couple of Project based questions.\nThe second round was with regional heads of ITC. This round majorly consisted of core questions apart from explaining my project in detail. The questions were:\n1) Can PNP and NPN transistors be reversibly used?\n3) Question about Synchronous Induction Motor.\n4) What is the significance of real and imaginary power?\nDescription of HR Round:\nHR round was a group discussion round wherein a random scenario was explained and we had to reflect on it. Communication skills, Thinking and Approach, confidence were tested.\nResum\u00e9 must be to the point as it played an important role in questions being posed. We must be confident enough to speak elaborately about any point mentioned in the resum\u00e9. Preparation must be done accordingly.\nApart from Academics, I didn't specially prepare for the interview.\nAdditional info for our viewers:\nI did some ground research about future plans of ITC, it's current projects and requirements and sectors in which the company is investing. This gave me an edge in the interview because I could confidently tell that this is what I bring to the table to match your requirements. I suggest any aspiring candidate to do the same. Know about your company, it's objectives, goals and requirements and answer accordingly.",

        "content": "Use tab to navigate through the menu items.\nComputer Science and Engineering\n1 OT ,2 technical interview and 1 HR round\nDescription of Online test:\nIn OT there will be 4 sections Verbal ability , Aptitude , computer science basics, coding section .\nIn every section there will be 3-4 sub sections which will have 7-8 qsns and time limit given.\nEvery section will have individual time limit like for aptitude it was 47 mins for 36 qsns for coding it was 35 mins for 30 qsns\nAnd there was no negative marking so you can mark every qsn without any fear\nIn verbal ability section there were qsns related to grammars like you have to correct some sentences , or choose a word which has similar meaning to given word, 4-5 qsns based on passage, rearrange words like this\nIn coding section there were qsns based on output predicting and depicting errors in functions and most importantly there were many qsns on AVL tree . So before sitting in ORACLE make sure to read about AVL tree\nIn computer science basics section There were qsns related to OS, DBMS,OOPs except OS all qsns were easy only and u can answer them if u have ur basics strong .\nIn Aptitude section there were common aptitude qsns like work and time , and pncs qsns u can find them on GFG , if u are a jee student then u can easily do those qsns , there was 1 section under aptitude know as flow chart based qsns in that part u will be given some instructions or algorithm to solve a qsn and on the basis of that a flow chart of that algo would be given to you and there will be some blanks in that flow chart that u will have to fill , so this is also a medium level qsn only\nTry to do best in ur OT  , yeah time wont be sufficient enough for some qsns in aptitude like i randomly ticked some qsns because time wasn't there , but dont worry u will not be alone who will be doing this .\nDescription of Technical Interview:\nROUND 1\nWhen the interviewer came , he asked me to intoduce myself so i did for 2-3 mins then he asked me how was ur  2nd year since ours was online thats why he asked for . Then he asked me a qsn about DOM that i didnt know because i didnt about XML so i told him that i dont know about this , if u dont know anything about a topic just tell them that u dont know .\nAfter that he asked me about DOM model , i think i dont quite remember the name but it was like this that u have to create a Generic BOM model that we can use for any product\nBOM model: lets understand it with an example lets say u have a product called PC (personal computer) so it can have many components like CPU, keyboard,mouse,printer etc and then again CPU can contain many components like SMPS,motherboard,hard disk , then again motherboard can contain many things like register , RAM, etc so as u can see their is an Heirarchy type of thing  . But in the start i didnt understand because the interviewer was also that explaining like i did here so i told them that i can make abstract classes of pc then i can implement them in the products then again use abstract classes and i will achieve that thing but it was not the right answer i thought so i then asked him that whether i have to give him a data structure or any oops soln so he asked me to give a data structure soln so i told them that since its heierarchial we can use K-ARY Tree for this , then he told me to draw it on white board the he asked me to code the structure  of the tree , and i easily coded it since i knew about K-ARY tree earlier only in KR sir's class. Then he asked me Whether i can implement this thing without using Data structure i was confused at this time so i asked him sir how we can implement this heirarchial thing without trees so he told me to do it in DBMS . So i told him that i would create 2 table , one for root id and second for Child table having root id as foreign key there and there will be one to many relationship from root to child , we can find the childs using root id then we can again use those child ids as root ids and recursively find all the childs of that node . He was pretty satisfied with this solution.\nThen he asked me to explain about my project , i was having a project on TODO list so i explained them how i made this and what problems i faced during the implementation of my project .\nThen he asked me how would i implement a Score board that will display runs and will auto maticlly refresh so i told them i can use Socket.io library(package) and achieve this , then he asked me whether i can do any alternative i said no sir i dont know\nThis concluded my 1st interview i was asked to wait in post interview round since i was selected for further round .\nLink to the pic of the BOM model :\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1DbjXvDZ57SYqgNedfG5qVIaBK3MQdOvB/view?usp=sharing\nROUND 2\nI was selected directly for 3rd round , though there were many students who has to give 3 round.\nDescription of HR Round:\nROUND 3\nIt was my HR round . When the HR came he asked me how was my last interview , i said sir it was good then he asked me what qsns did he asked and what solns i gave so i explained my first round to him then upon hearing my Tree answer he asked my is there only need of searching and sorting in tree , is tree useful for any other things ? i told him we use it for maintaining hierarchical order and then again he asked my what if i didn't take unique values means what if I will take repeated data then I explained him with the concepts of database like data redundancy and data inconsistency and he was satisfied with it Then he asked me what if i didn't took sorted values , i explained him with indexing of dbms that we take sorted values for logn searching etc. Then he asked my what do u feel as a computer science undergraduate , so u have to give ur honest answer for this and i gave something like there's always learning in CS and everytime u know that u have became superior there is someone who is already superior that u and u try learning hard etc... then he asked me how my friends affected my learning and life so i told them u can frame ur own answer on this . Then he asked my why u want to join oracle u can google search about these things and then he told me we are done for today .\nYou can easily crack the OT of oracle but to crack interviews u should have good knowledge of object oriented programming, DBMS, DSA.\nfor DSA solve questions from leetcode around 400-500 will be fine.\nleetcode have 3 category of questions easy , medium and hard try to solve more medium level questions rather than easy ones.\nApart from leetcode practice on codeforces and score a good rating there by participating the contests atleast 1200-1300 rating is good enough.\nleetcode, codeforces, codechef, hackerrank\nAdditional info for our viewers:",

Aptitude and English sections were easy and these sections were MCQs.\n2. In the technical section, there were questions (MCQs) on HTML and CSS (mainly related to Web Dev). Very few MCQs were on DSA and the questions were on the topic of hashing (linear and quadratic probing).\n3. Coding section was very easy. 2 simple coding questions (I chose C++) were asked and no DSA was required. 2 SQL query questions were also asked.\nDescription of Technical Interview:\nRound-1:\nIt started with the interviewer asking me to introduce myself. She looked at my resume and asked me regarding my hobbies for the 1st 5 minutes. Then she asked me basic questions on SQL like what are DML and DDL commands, differences and examples. She asked 2 SQL queries which I answered correctly. Few questions on OOPS related to inheritance and polymorphism were asked. Again 2 very simple C++ questions were asked which I don't remember now.\nRound-2:\nIt was supposed to be a technical round, however the interviewer asked me only HR questions.\nDescription of HR Round:\nRound-3:\nSince there were practically 2 HR rounds for me, I was asked almost all std HR questions like strengths and weaknesses, why do you want to work for our company, etc. and also a lot of other different types of HR questions.\nDSA - LeetCode, InterviewBit\nSQL - w3schools for learning and practice on HackerRank\nOOPS - Saurabh Shukla YT channel\nAdditional info for our viewers:",

There were 3 sections in the OT. Aptitude, C-Programming, Profile Dependent (Software, Hardware). Each of these 3 sections had 20 questions and 30 minutes was given for each section. So, 90 mins in total. Each Question carried +1 for correct and -0.25 negative marking for wrong answers.\nThere were questions on-\nA Paragraph on Seating Arrangement based on which 5 questions were asked.\nOne Data Interpretation question based on which 5 questions were asked.\nOverall, this section is easy, just keep a watch on TIME!\n\u200bBasic C questions on-\nFew Questions from Data Structures like\n1 Question from Operating System\nThis section had questions on-\nImplementation of function using a minimum number of NAND/ NOR gates.\nFew questions on CMOS\n1 Question on microcontrollers, ADC, OpAmps.\nDescription of Technical Interview:\nAfter the OT, there was a Technical Interview the next day. Interviews were held on Microsoft Teams. The interviewer was very friendly. He started with my Hobbies first.\nThen moved to my Formal Introduction. Tip: Remember the Headers on your resume and briefly explain about each section. Introduction shouldn't take more than 2 mins. If the interviewer is interested, he'll ask more specifically about that part.\nFirst, he asked me about the NAND gate then asked me to design it from a Transistor (BJT or MOS). He asked about ALU, it's working and asked me to make one.\nHe asked me to Write a code for an array of function pointers that point to 10 different functions. Some other basic C-related questions were asked.\nHe was very interested in my projects. He asked me to explain in detail about our e-yantra project. We spent almost 8 mins here. I hope the importance of projects is very clear at this point.\nHe then asked about my Positions of Responsibility. I was in both ECEA and EA & HAM Club, I explained in brief what we do here and my role there.\nIt was a short interview for 30 Mins.\nDescription of HR Round:\n2 hours after the Technical Interview, there was a call from HR.\nThe HR round lasted approximately for 5 mins. It was a casual telephonic call.\n1. She asked me to introduce myself and tell about my family\n2. My feedback on the Technical Interview Round.\n3. Why do I want to join Qualcomm?\n4. What are my long-term goals?\n5. My Work Location preferences?\n6. Do I have any questions?\nFor that, I asked what does the company expect from a fresher and which projects I will be working on if I get selected.\nThat was it. Nothing Technical Here :)\nOne Hour after the HR round, the Final Select List was released.\nThe first important thing is to know what to prepare, the syllabus, what kind of questions the company asks, where to find the resources.\nLearn to invest your time efficiently.\nIf you're in ECE 2nd year and decided to choose Hardware, then I'd suggest developing a good understanding of EDC, DSD, NA, SS, Control Systems in the curriculum itself.

We can choose any sections we want. The above 3 sections are not compulsory for everyone so I choose both analog and digital sections. Questions asked in the analog section are pretty tricky and also some questions are lengthy. the analog section covers topics like OPAMPs, Rc-Circuits(very important), MOSFETs, BJTs, and Diode circuits .one should practice a lot of questions from the above topics I prefer sedra smith and gate questions for practice and also listen to Razavi lectures(electronics-1 playlist)  in youtube. those lectures are very well explained by Razavi himself (these lectures are very important for a basic understanding of analog electronics; he is a masterpiece If I can say in one word).\nIn the Digital section questions are asked from topics like counters,8086 microcontroller, pipeline registers, setup time, Hold Time, Verilog, and FSM. etc questions are pretty easy basic concepts are required.I prefer Bhima Shankar sir lectures from the Kreatryx channel(\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs5_Rtf2P2r77kmBnXAe06RsI3VadeQ5s\nFollow this playlist ) and practice previous year gate questions.\nDescription of Technical Interview:\nI was selected for both analog and digital Roles\nFor Analog Role The interview started with a self-introduction. there are two  interviewers  for me they are very friendly so don't need to panic after that one of the interviewers posed a question about the Rc circuit and asked about output voltage it is an easy question but tricky they give lots of time to think so don't panic keep calm and think correctly and asked a couple of questions from Rc circuits they are very easy (do lots of Questions  from Rc circuits I prefer Nagendra Krishnapura  lectures and follow this blog\nhttp://coreplacementsnsit.blogspot.com/2018/08/hi-i-am-rachit_14.html?m=1)\nand then after they moved onto diode circuits asked output  voltage of peak detector circuit and clipper circuits they are easy questions as I practiced a lot of questions on Diode circuits from sedra smith  and they asked  basic questions on oscillators (OPAMP) the overall duration of the interview is 50 minutes lastly I will say one important thing in the interview try question even if you don't know the answer they will see your approach not the final answer so approach is very important not answer.\nDescription of HR Round:\n2-3 months of rigorous practice and revision is enough to crack the internship. consistency and revision are two important factors. I started my preparation during the summer vacation, before that I was weak in analog electronics. I didn't even know some basic concepts. I prefer Razavi's lectures and Razavi's book for concept-building and practice purposes. if you have enough time do problems from sedra smith\nRazavi lectures(electronics-1 playlist is enough for internship )\nsedra smith (for diode circuits and OPAMPs)\nAk Chakraborty for basic  circuit theory\nNagendra krishnapura  lectures(Especially For OPAMP and RC circuits )\nFollow this blog its very useful\nhttp://coreplacementsnsit.blogspot.com/2018/08/hi-i-am-rachit_14.html?m=1\nAdditional info for our viewers:",

He started questioning from that domain. Most of them are from Verilog language. You need to have a clear understanding of all operators and loops, blocking and non blocking assignment, flow of compilation of programs. Questions were a bit tacky but the interviewer tries to help you with some clues which you must be able to catch on time. After 1 hr on Verilog ,He moved to digital electronics and some OT questions where you have to justify your answer. It lasted for nearly 3 hours.\nDescription of HR Round:\nAll you need is 2-3 months for complete preparation. Have a clear understanding of concepts and get all your doubts cleared before the exam. Try to have deep knowledge in one or two areas and just move the interviewer's eye on these topics by relating every question into them. Then you can pull it off easily if you are calm and confident. The interviewer will be ready to help you if you get stuck somewhere, all you need to do is analyze the question as much as you can until you untie it. Be confident about what you have answered and try to have a two way communication rather than like a question-answer session.\n1. Morris mano for digital electronics\n2.

It was basically a managerial cum technical round. He asked me about my branch and my jee score. His focus was also on your communication as well as presentation skill. Then he asked me basic question on dsa and finally asked to code a question on my favorite data structure\nDescription of HR Round:\nIt was not an elimination round for us. It was a telephonic round and she asked me my name and my interview experience and any doubts about the internship.\nFirst and foremost make a good command on dsa. Try to solve as many questions as you can. For beginner level you can practice on hackerrank and then move to leetcode/gfg.I will prefer leetcode over gfg. Trees, linked lists, and stack are the most important data structures. You can also do some competitive programming from codeforces.
